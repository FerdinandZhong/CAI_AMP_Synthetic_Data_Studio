Generate synthetic banking data with three interconnected datasets: Customers, Accounts, and Transactions.
This structure simulates a normalized relational database with proper foreign key relationships.

**CRITICAL REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Each customer must have a unique cust_id
2. Each account must reference a valid cust_id from the customers dataset
3. Each transaction must reference a valid account_id from the accounts dataset
4. A customer can have 1-5 accounts
5. Each account should have 2-20 transactions

**DATASET 1: CUSTOMERS**
Fields:
- cust_id: Unique customer identifier (format: C10001, C10002, etc.)
- first_name: Customer's first name (synthetic)
- last_name: Customer's last name (synthetic)
- date_of_birth: Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD format, age between 18-80)
- email: Email address (synthetic, format: name@domain.com)
- phone: Phone number (format: 555-XXXX)
- address: Street address (synthetic)
- city: City name
- state: Two-letter state code
- zip_code: 5-digit ZIP code
- customer_since: Account opening date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- customer_segment: One of ["Retail", "Small Business", "Young Professional", "Retiree", "High Net Worth"]
- credit_score: Integer between 300-850

**DATASET 2: ACCOUNTS**
Fields:
- account_id: Unique account identifier (format: A10001, A10002, etc.)
- cust_id: Foreign key to customers.cust_id (MUST exist in customers dataset)
- account_type: One of ["Checking", "Savings", "Business Checking", "Money Market", "CD"]
- account_status: One of ["Active", "Inactive", "Closed", "Frozen"]
- open_date: Account opening date (YYYY-MM-DD, must be >= customer_since)
- current_balance: Decimal number (can be negative for overdrafts)
- currency: "USD"
- interest_rate: Decimal percentage (0.01 to 5.0)
- overdraft_limit: Decimal number (0 for savings, 500-5000 for checking)

**DATASET 3: TRANSACTIONS**
Fields:
- transaction_id: Unique transaction identifier (format: T10001, T10002, etc.)
- account_id: Foreign key to accounts.account_id (MUST exist in accounts dataset)
- transaction_date: Date of transaction (YYYY-MM-DD)
- transaction_time: Time of transaction (HH:MM:SS)
- transaction_type: One of ["Credit", "Debit"]
- transaction_category: One of ["Groceries", "Salary", "ATM Withdrawal", "Transfer", "Interest", "Bill Payment", "Business Income", "Business Expense", "Rent", "Utilities"]
- amount: Decimal number (negative for debits, positive for credits)
- merchant_name: Name of merchant or source/destination
- description: Brief transaction description
- balance_after: Account balance after this transaction

**CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Referential Integrity:**
   - All cust_id values in accounts must exist in customers
   - All account_id values in transactions must exist in accounts
   - Never create orphan records

2. **Temporal Consistency:**
   - customer_since must be before all account open_date values for that customer
   - Transaction dates must be on or after the account open_date
   - Transactions should be in chronological order within each account
   - balance_after should reflect cumulative effect of transactions

3. **Business Logic:**
   - Savings accounts cannot have negative balances
   - Checking accounts can go negative up to overdraft_limit
   - Interest rate should align with account type (Savings: 1-3%, Checking: 0-0.5%, CD: 3-5%)
   - Account status "Closed" should have current_balance = 0
   - Small Business segment should primarily have Business Checking accounts
   - High Net Worth customers should have higher balances (>$100k total)

4. **Data Quality:**
   - No real personal information (use synthetic names, addresses)
   - Email should be derivable from first_name.last_name but don't use actual domains
   - Phone numbers should use 555 prefix
   - Credit scores should align with customer segment (High Net Worth: 750+, Young Professional: 650-750)
   - Transaction amounts should be realistic for the category

5. **Privacy Guidelines:**
   - Avoid real PII
   - Ensure examples are not leaked into synthetic data
   - Use generic merchant names

6. **Formatting Guidelines:**
   - All monetary amounts as decimals with 2 decimal places
   - Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Times in HH:MM:SS format
   - IDs must be unique across the entire dataset

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Generate JSON with the structure shown in the examples:
{
    "customer": {...},
    "accounts": [{...}, {...}],
    "transactions": [{...}, {...}, ...]
}

Each JSON object should represent one complete customer with all their accounts and transactions.
