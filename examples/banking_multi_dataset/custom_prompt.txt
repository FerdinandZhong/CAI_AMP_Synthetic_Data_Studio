Generate synthetic banking data for Singapore with three interconnected datasets: Customers, Accounts, and Transactions.
This structure simulates a normalized relational database with proper foreign key relationships.

**CRITICAL REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Each customer must have a unique cust_id
2. Each account must reference a valid cust_id from the customers dataset
3. Each transaction must reference a valid account_id from the accounts dataset
4. A customer can have 1-5 accounts
5. Each account should have 2-20 transactions

**DATASET 1: CUSTOMERS**
Fields:
- cust_id: Unique customer identifier (format: C10001, C10002, etc.)
- first_name: Customer's first name (synthetic)
- last_name: Customer's last name (synthetic)
- date_of_birth: Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD format, age between 18-80)
- email: Email address (synthetic, format: name@domain.com)
- phone: Phone number (Singapore format: XXXX-XXXX, 8 digits starting with 6, 8, or 9)
- address: Street address (synthetic, Singapore location)
- branch: Banking branch location (e.g., "Marina Bay Branch", "Orchard Branch", "Jurong Branch", "Tampines Branch", "Clementi Branch")
- postal_code: Singapore postal code (6-digit format: XXXXXX)
- region: Singapore postal region code (two letters: SG followed by region indicator)
- customer_since: Account opening date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- customer_segment: One of ["Retail", "Small Business", "Young Professional", "Retiree", "High Net Worth"]
- credit_score: Integer between 300-850

**DATASET 2: ACCOUNTS**
Fields:
- account_id: Unique account identifier (format: A10001, A10002, etc.)
- cust_id: Foreign key to customers.cust_id (MUST exist in customers dataset)
- account_type: One of ["Checking", "Savings", "Business Checking", "Money Market", "Fixed Deposit"]
- account_status: One of ["Active", "Inactive", "Closed", "Frozen"]
- open_date: Account opening date (YYYY-MM-DD, must be >= customer_since)
- current_balance: Decimal number in SGD (can be negative for overdrafts)
- currency: "SGD"
- interest_rate: Decimal percentage (0.01 to 4.5)
- overdraft_limit: Decimal number in SGD (0 for savings, 1000-10000 for checking)

**DATASET 3: TRANSACTIONS**
Fields:
- transaction_id: Unique transaction identifier (format: T10001, T10002, etc.)
- account_id: Foreign key to accounts.account_id (MUST exist in accounts dataset)
- transaction_date: Date of transaction (YYYY-MM-DD)
- transaction_time: Time of transaction (HH:MM:SS)
- transaction_type: One of ["Credit", "Debit"]
- transaction_category: One of ["Groceries", "Salary", "ATM Withdrawal", "Transfer", "Interest", "Bill Payment", "Business Income", "Business Expense", "Rent", "Utilities"]
- amount: Decimal number (negative for debits, positive for credits)
- merchant_name: Name of merchant or source/destination
- description: Brief transaction description
- balance_after: Account balance after this transaction

**CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Referential Integrity:**
   - All cust_id values in accounts must exist in customers
   - All account_id values in transactions must exist in accounts
   - Never create orphan records

2. **Temporal Consistency:**
   - customer_since must be before all account open_date values for that customer
   - Transaction dates must be on or after the account open_date
   - Transactions should be in chronological order within each account
   - balance_after should reflect cumulative effect of transactions

3. **Business Logic:**
   - Savings accounts cannot have negative balances
   - Checking accounts can go negative up to overdraft_limit
   - Interest rate should align with account type (Savings: 0.5-2%, Checking: 0-0.25%, Fixed Deposit: 2-4.5%)
   - Account status "Closed" should have current_balance = 0
   - Small Business segment should primarily have Business Checking accounts
   - High Net Worth customers should have higher balances (>SGD 250,000 total)
   - All balances in Singapore Dollars (SGD)

4. **Data Quality:**
   - No real personal information (use synthetic names, addresses in Singapore)
   - Email should be derivable from first_name.last_name but don't use actual domains
   - Phone numbers should follow Singapore format: 8 digits (6, 8, or 9 prefix) formatted as XXXX-XXXX
   - Credit scores should align with customer segment (High Net Worth: 750+, Young Professional: 650-750)
   - Transaction amounts should be realistic for the category in SGD
   - Singapore postal codes: 6 digits (e.g., 018955, 039594)

5. **Privacy Guidelines:**
   - Avoid real PII
   - Ensure examples are not leaked into synthetic data
   - Use generic merchant names

6. **Formatting Guidelines:**
   - All monetary amounts as decimals with 2 decimal places
   - Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Times in HH:MM:SS format
   - IDs must be unique across the entire dataset

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Generate JSON with the structure shown in the examples:
{
    "customer": {...},
    "accounts": [{...}, {...}],
    "transactions": [{...}, {...}, ...]
}

Each JSON object should represent one complete customer with all their accounts and transactions.
