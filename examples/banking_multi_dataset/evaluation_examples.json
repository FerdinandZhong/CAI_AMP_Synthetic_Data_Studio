    "quality": "Excellent",
    "justification": "Score: 9/10. The dataset maintains excellent referential integrity with all customer IDs, account IDs, and transaction IDs properly linked. All customers have valid Singapore phone numbers (8765-4321, 9123-4560, 6234-5678), valid 6-digit postal codes (628554, 018981, 238823), and nationalities from the approved list (Singaporean, Malaysian, Indian). Account branches are properly specified (Marina Bay Branch, Orchard Branch, Jurong Branch). Temporal consistency is impeccable - all transaction dates follow account opening dates which follow customer creation dates. Interest rates are realistic for Singapore banking (Checking: 0.10%, Savings: 1.25-1.50%, Fixed Deposit: 3.75%). SGD currency is consistently used with proper 2-decimal formatting. Minor deduction: (1) One customer email uses a real domain 'gmail.com' instead of synthetic domain (-1 point). Otherwise, all business logic rules are maintained (Savings accounts positive balance, Checking accounts within overdraft limits), no duplicate IDs, and data quality is exceptional."

    "score": 7,
    "quality": "Good",
    "justification": "Score: 7/10. Referential integrity is well maintained with proper foreign key relationships and no orphan records. Phone numbers follow Singapore format correctly (9456-7890, 8234-5678, 6789-1234). Postal codes are valid 6-digit format (456789, 123456, 789012). Nationalities are from approved list (Singaporean, Thai, Filipino). Branch locations exist (Clementi Branch, Tampines Branch). Deductions: (1) One customer has credit_score of 820 while marked as 'Young Professional' segment, should typically be 650-750 (-1 point), (2) Account A10015 is Savings type with interest_rate of 2.5% which exceeds Singapore standards (should be max 2%) (-1 point), (3) Transaction T10045 has balance_after that doesn't match cumulative calculations (-1 point). All other checks pass: temporal consistency maintained, currency in SGD with proper formatting, no duplicate IDs, business logic mostly sound except noted violations."

    "score": 5,
    "quality": "Acceptable",
    "justification": "Score: 5/10. Basic referential integrity maintained but with some issues. Phone numbers mostly valid Singapore format but one customer has '91234567' (missing dash, not XXXX-XXXX format) (-1 point). Postal codes mostly 6-digit but one has '12345' (only 5 digits) (-1 point). Nationality field has one entry 'European' not from approved list (-1 point). Account branch locations specified but one is simply 'Branch' without location name (-1 point). Temporal issues: Customer C20015 has customer_since='2023-01-15' but account A20030 has open_date='2022-06-01' which is before customer creation (-2 points). Interest rates mostly appropriate but Account A20025 (Checking) has 0.8% rate which exceeds checking standard of 0.25% (-1 point). SGD currency properly used with 2 decimal places. No orphan records or duplicate IDs. Overall usable with caveats but requires some data cleaning before production use."

    "quality": "Poor",
    "justification": "Score: 3/10. Multiple serious violations found. Referential integrity issues: (1) Transaction T30005 references account_id 'A99999' which doesn't exist in accounts dataset (-4 points), (2) Account A30020 references customer C50001 but customer dataset only has C30001-C30010 (-4 points). Format violations: (1) Customer C30003 has phone number '555-1234' (US format, not Singapore 6/8/9 prefix) (-1 point), (2) Customer C30007 postal code 'SG123456' (contains letters, should be 6 digits only) (-1 point), (3) Customer C30005 has nationality 'British' not from approved list (-1 point). Temporal violations: (1) Customer C30002 has customer_since='2020-03-15' but account open_date='2015-09-20' is 4.5 years earlier (-2 points). Business logic: (1) Savings account A30012 has current_balance=-350.50 SGD (negative balance not allowed) (-1 point), (2) Fixed Deposit account A30015 has interest_rate of 5.2% exceeding maximum 4.5% (-1 point). Data quality: Branch field missing for 3 accounts, one customer email is real 'john.smith@example.com'. The dataset has critical issues and is not suitable for use without major corrections."

    "score": 1,
    "quality": "Unusable",
    "justification": "Score: 1/10. Critical failures across multiple dimensions make this dataset unusable. Referential Integrity Catastrophe: (1) 15+ transactions reference non-existent accounts (-60+ points if counted individually), (2) 8 accounts reference non-existent customers (-32+ points), (3) Duplicate transaction IDs found (T40001 appears 3 times) (-4 points), (4) Duplicate account IDs (A40005 appears twice) (-4 points). Privacy Violations: (1) Customer names include real persons 'John Smith', 'Mary Johnson' (-2 points), (2) Actual merchant names used 'DBS Bank', 'OCBC' instead of synthetic (-2 points), (3) Addresses include real Singapore locations 'Blk 123 Tiong Bahru Road' with real postal code '160123' (-2 points). Format Failures: All phone numbers missing dashes (e.g., '91234567' instead of XXXX-XXXX), all postal codes contain letters or wrong format, nationalities include invalid entries like 'American', 'European'. Temporal Disasters: Multiple accounts predate customer creation by years, transactions dated before account opening across entire dataset. Business Logic: Savings accounts frequently negative, Checking accounts 50,000 SGD over limit, Closed accounts with large balances. Currency: Mix of SGD and USD without consistency. This dataset cannot be salvaged without complete regeneration."
