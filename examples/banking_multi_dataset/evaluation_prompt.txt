You are evaluating synthetic banking data for Singapore with three interconnected datasets: Customers, Accounts, and Transactions.

All monetary amounts should be in SGD (Singapore Dollars). Phone numbers should follow Singapore format (XXXX-XXXX, 8 digits starting with 6, 8, or 9). Postal codes should be 6-digit Singapore format (XXXXXX). Customers can be of various nationalities (Singaporean, Malaysian, Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian, Thai, etc.). Accounts are associated with banking branch locations.

**Evaluation Criteria (10-point scale):**

Start with 10 points and deduct for violations:

1. **Privacy Violations (-2 points each):**
   - Real person names, addresses, or contact information
   - Leaked example data
   - Use of actual company names or real merchants

2. **Referential Integrity Violations (-4 points each):**
   - account.cust_id references non-existent customer
   - transaction.account_id references non-existent account
   - Orphan records in any dataset
   - Duplicate IDs within a dataset (duplicate cust_id, account_id, or transaction_id)

3. **Temporal Consistency Violations (-2 points each):**
   - account.open_date before customer.customer_since
   - transaction.transaction_date before account.open_date
   - Transactions not in chronological order for the same account
   - Invalid date formats or impossible dates

4. **Business Logic Violations (-1 point each):**
   - Savings account with negative balance
   - Checking account balance exceeding overdraft limit (more negative than -overdraft_limit)
   - Closed account with non-zero balance
   - Interest rate doesn't match account type (e.g., Savings > 2%, Checking > 0.25%, Fixed Deposit > 4.5% - Singapore rates)
   - Customer segment doesn't match account holdings (e.g., Small Business without Business Checking)
   - Credit score outside valid range (300-850)
   - Invalid branch name (should be valid Singapore banking branch location)

5. **Data Quality Issues (-1 point each):**
   - Formatting errors (dates not in YYYY-MM-DD, times not in HH:MM:SS)
   - Monetary amounts not properly formatted (should have 2 decimal places)
   - Unrealistic values (credit_score > 850, age < 18 or > 120)
   - balance_after calculation errors
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid enum values (e.g., account_type not in allowed list)

6. **Cross-Column Consistency (-1 point each):**
   - Email doesn't follow reasonable pattern from name
   - Credit score doesn't align with customer segment
   - Phone number doesn't follow Singapore format (XXXX-XXXX, 8 digits starting with 6, 8, or 9)
   - Transaction category doesn't match merchant type
   - Postal code doesn't follow Singapore 6-digit format (XXXXXX)
   - Customer age incompatible with account history (e.g., 20-year-old with 30-year account history)
   - Nationality field not from valid list (e.g., "Singaporean", "Malaysian", "Indian", "Chinese", "Filipino", "Indonesian", "Thai")

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Excellent - No major violations, minor issues only
- 7-8: Good - A few minor violations but maintains referential integrity
- 5-6: Acceptable - Some violations but generally usable
- 3-4: Poor - Multiple serious violations including referential integrity issues
- 1-2: Unusable - Critical referential integrity violations, privacy issues, or severe data quality problems

**Required Output Format:**
Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{
    "score": <number between 1-10>,
    "justification": "<detailed explanation of score with specific violations found>"
}

In your justification:
1. List all violations found, grouped by category
2. Explain how each violation impacted the score
3. Highlight any particularly good aspects of the data
4. Note if referential integrity is maintained (this is critical)
5. Provide specific examples of violations (e.g., "Transaction T10005 references non-existent account A99999")

**Example Good Justification:**
"Score: 8/10. The data maintains excellent referential integrity with all foreign keys properly linked. All customers have valid Singapore branches and valid nationalities. Minor deductions: (1) Customer C10001's email 'sarah.lim@gmail.com' uses a real domain (-1 point), (2) Account A10002 has interest_rate of 0.25% which is slightly high for savings (-1 point). Otherwise, temporal consistency is maintained, business logic is sound, and formatting is correct with proper SGD currency and phone formats."

**Example Poor Justification:**
"Score: 3/10. Multiple critical issues: (1) Transaction T10003 references account_id 'A99999' which doesn't exist in accounts dataset (-4 points), (2) Customer C10002 has customer_since='2020-05-10' but their account open_date='2018-01-15' which is temporally impossible (-2 points), (3) Account A10004 is a Savings account with current_balance=-500.00 SGD violating business rules (-1 point), (4) Customer C10001 has phone number '555-0123' which is not valid Singapore format (should be XXXX-XXXX with 6, 8, or 9 prefix) (-1 point), (5) Customer C10003 has invalid nationality 'British' not from approved list (-1 point). The data is not usable due to referential integrity and format violations."
