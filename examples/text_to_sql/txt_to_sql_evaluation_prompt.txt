Below is a SQL Query Question and Solution pair generated for TEXT2SQL 
training data. Evaluate its quality as a training example using these 
criteria:

**1. Schema Validity (Critical)**
- Deduct 4 points if any table name doesn't exist in schema
- Deduct 4 points if any column name is invalid for the table
- Deduct 4 points if JOINs reference non-existent FK relationships
- Deduct 2 points if data type operations are inappropriate

**2. Question-Query Alignment (Critical)**
- Deduct 4 points if the SQL doesn't answer the question
- Deduct 2 points if the question is ambiguous or unclear
- Deduct 2 points if required information is missing from results
- Deduct 1 point if the query over-selects columns

**3. SQL Correctness (Critical)**
- Deduct 4 points if query has syntax errors
- Deduct 2 points if GROUP BY missing required columns
- Deduct 2 points if aggregate functions used incorrectly
- Deduct 1 point if column references are ambiguous

**4. Query Patterns (Educational Value)**
Identify which SQL patterns the query demonstrates:
- Basic SELECT/WHERE ✓
- JOINs ✓
- GROUP BY/HAVING ✓
- Aggregate functions ✓
- Subqueries ✓
- Window functions ✓

**5. Clarity & Simplicity**
- Question should be unambiguous (+1 for clarity)
- Query should use straightforward logic (+1 for simplicity)
- Both should be understandable for learning (+1 for pedagogical value)

Scoring (10-point scale, starting at 10):
- 9-10: Excellent training example - valid, clear, correct
- 7-8: Good - minor issues but educational
- 5-6: Acceptable - works but could be clearer
- 3-4: Poor - significant issues, limited value
- 1-2: Unusable - schema/correctness issues

**Output Format:**
{
  "score": <number>,
  "validity": "<valid/invalid tables, columns, joins>",
  "question_alignment": "<does query answer question?>",
  "patterns": "<list SQL patterns used>",
  "issues": "<any schema/correctness issues>",
  "justification": "<explanation of score>"
}
